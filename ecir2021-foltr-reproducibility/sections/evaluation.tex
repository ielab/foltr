\section{Experimental Settings}



\subsection{Datasets}
The datasets we use are MQ2007 and MQ2008~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/QinL13}, MLSR-WEB10K\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/QinL13} and Yahoo! Webscope~\cite{DBLP:journals/jmlr/ChapelleC11} datasets. More detailed information for each dataset can be found in Table X.

MQ2007 dataset contains 1692 unique queries and 69623 relevance labels. MQ2008 dataset contains 784 unique queries and 15211 relevance labels. For MQ2007 and MQ2008 dataset, each query-document pair contains 46 features.

Each dataset is provided with five splits, except for Yahoo! Webscope.

We use the original dataset in training and validating procedure without any preprocessing, such as feature normalization.
